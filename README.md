Point of learning C [[article](https://www.cio.com/article/3169540/what-is-the-point-of-learning-c.html)]

- For traditional workloads there is no need to be counting the bytes like there used to be. But when it comes to IoT applications there is that need once again. So we may well see a resurgence in demand for C skills.
- It is better to get a grounding in the fundamentals in a higher level language and then do a deep dive into C if you want to do high-performance programming.
- Knowledge of C is highly marketable for summer internships, UROPs, and full-time positions in software and embedded systems development.
